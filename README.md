# Augeo Take Home Project

## Overview

- Uses an in-memory data store, so data is not persisted across runs, but it's easy to add data persistence by implementing the data layer interface used by the endpoints in the server.
- Apollo graphql is used for serving data and it also provides studio at `/graphql`.
- To run or test the server, you must provide a `.env` file after the example in `example-env-file`.
- To run the server, run `npm start` and to test the server, run `npm test`.
